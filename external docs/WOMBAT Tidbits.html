<hr>
WOMBAT is the name for the motherboard used in the Centris 650, Quadra 
650, and Quadra 800 computers.  The presence or absence of some surface 
mount resistors on the bottom of the board, and an LED assembly, change 
the computers identity.  Depending on these variables, the computer 
identifies itself as a C650, Q650, Q800, or one of two new, unreleased 
and previously unobserved machines.  The conversion between these five 
machines is reversible and independent of processor speed.
<p>
The table below tabulates the variables I have studied.  Surface mount 
resistors were either absent from the pads for R151 and R152, or present
 on just R151 or R152.  The Quadra 800 uses a 5 pin connector at J25 to 
supply power to a LED power indicator.  The Centris and Quadra 650 use 
an LED at D51 for this purpose (The Quadra 800 also has this diode, but 
the light it emits is not visible when the motherboard is situated 
inside the case).  The connector that grabs pins 1 and 5 from J25 on the
 Quadra 800 for the LED also serves a second purpose.  It has a jumper 
wire between pins 2 and 3.  This jumper wire identifies the computer as 
one with an upright board, and hence a Q800.  The WOMBAT board can also 
be fitted with an Apple PPC PDS card, and that accounts for the second 
half of the table.  The numbers listed in the table are mach gestalts; 
they are numbers that identify the machine type.

The serial ports fail above 30MHz under the conditions for gestalt 30, 
but they are fine at 40MHz under the conditions for gestalts 35, 36, 51,
 59, 120, 122, and 123.<br>
The modification for converting a Centris 650 to a Quadra 650 is outlined in Marlin Prowell's  (<a href="mailto:mbp@janus.com">mbp@janus.com</a>) <a href="http://www.applefool.com/clockchipping/c650.html">C650 Serial Port Modification file</a>.
<p>
The current (released) system software for 68040 machines, 7.5.1, has 
the proper resources for mach gestalt 59, but it does not have them for 
mach gestalt 51.  If for some reason you want to get a WOMBAT board up 
and running with mach gestalt 51, drop me a line, and I'll send you a 
patch.

When you run these machines around 40/80MHz, video problems seem to be 
the limiting factor.  If you have a PPC card you can pull out the 68040 
if you never switch back to it, and you will be able to squeeze out a 
few extra MHz.  It has also been noted that if you use a video card you 
can also squeeze out a few additional MHz.  One clock chipper dropped a 
Supermac SpectrumV Series 5 card into his C650/PPC and got it up to 
85MHz.  His processor was not stable at 86MHz.
