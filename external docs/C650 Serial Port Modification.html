Subject: Centris 650 at 40 MHz ... *with* serial ports<br>
Date: Fri, 01 Apr 1994 07:30:32 -0800<br>
<hr>
I have a Centris 650.  I have followed with great interest the articles that Marc Schrier<br>
(<a href="mailto:schrier@mac.com">schrier@mac.com</a>) has written about
 clock chipping of recent Macs, but was disappointed that Centris 650's 
could only be accelerated from 25 MHz to about 28 MHz before the serial 
ports would fail.  It didn't seem worth the effort.
<p>
In September, 1993, James McPhail (<a href="mailto:jmacphai@cue.bc.ca">jmacphai@cue.bc.ca</a>)
 wrote that he had a Centris 650 running at 40 MHz.  He fixed the serial
 port problem by adding to the motherboard a PAL that he had programmed.
  It is an exotic solution, and not meant for the faint-hearted.
</p><p>
But it was James that also suggested another avenue.  He said that 
someone should compare the motherboards of a Quadra 800 with a Centris 
650, and see if there were any differences around the IOSB (the serial 
I/O chip).
</p><p>
This is what I have done.  I first checked the ROM contents and found 
that they are identical.  The motherboards for the Q800 and C650 are 
identical, and have *almost* identical parts installed on them. On the 
underside of the board, underneath the IOSB chip, there are two 
differences.  R151 is installed on a C650, and is missing on a Q800.  
R152 is missing on the C650, and is installed on the Q800.
</p><p>
With this information, I ordered the parts for a clock chipping kit, 
along with a resistor to install as R152.  I first installed different 
oscillators without changing the motherboard.  The fastest crystal I 
ordered was 20 MHz (to run the computer at 40 MHz), and the machine ran 
at 40 MHz.  Of course, the serial ports did not work.
</p><p>
I then changed the resistors on the motherboard (details below), and 
tried again.  Now *everything* works at 40 MHz.  I have used the modem 
port, and printed from the printer port.  I have tried both LocalTalk 
and the Ethernet port, and all work fine.  The floppy drive also works.
</p><p>
I ran MacCheck 1.0.5 on the machine.  When I tried MacCheck before 
modifying the motherboard, it hung when trying to access the modem port.
  After changing the motherboard, it reported that there were no 
problems.  It also reported that I had a *Quadra* 650 running at 40 MHz.
</p><p>
That was a surprise.  I checked the "About This Macintosh" box in the 
Finder, and it also reported that I had a Quadra 650.  This is important
 to know.  If you make this modification, you 
*must* install System Enabler 040 Version 1.1 first.  This is the 
version meant for the Quadra 610 and 650, and is backwards compatible 
with the Centris 650. If you do not, your machine will refuse to boot, 
saying that you need to install newer software.  You must install 
version 1.1 on every bootable disk, including all your emergency floppy 
disks, and your Disk Tools floppy.
</p><p>
It also seems a little unusual that modifying a Centris 650 motherboard 
so that it is identical to a Quadra 800 board instead turns it into a 
Quadra 650 motherboard.  Only Apple knows what is going on.  A Quadra 
650 requires 80 ns DRAM, whereas a Quadra 800 requires 60 ns DRAM.  
There must be some difference in the on-board memory system that the ROM
 can detect.
</p><p>
I didn't expect to be able to accelerate the machine up to 40 MHz.  I 
expected that memory access time would limit the modification.  I can 
only guess that the memory system has it's own timing circuit that is 
not derived from the system clock, so speeding up the processor does not
 speed up memory access requirements.
</p><p>
Making the modification
</p><p>
I have done a little hardware work, but I am no expert at it (I'm a 
software guy).  I'll outline the procedure that I followed, and you can 
modify it if you have better tools than I do.
</p><p>
Warning:  you are making modifications that void your warranty. Also, I 
cannot promise that these changes will be successful for you.  You could
 ruin your motherboard attempting these changes.  The resistors are 
incredibly small, and changing them requires a delicate touch.  If you 
have any doubt about your soldering and electronics skills, get someone 
else to make the changes.

You will need one 1.2K 1/10 watt surface mount resistor (type 0805) to 
install as R152.  I ordered mine from DigiKey when I ordered the rest of
 the clock chipping kit.  The DigiKey part number is P1.2KABK, which is a
 package of 200 resistors for $6.01.  This is the minimum number of 
resistors you can buy from them.  The Panasonic part number for the 
resistor is ERJ-6GEYJ122.  The resistor should have the number 122 on 
the top.  You'll need a magnifying glass to read it, however.
</p><p>
To make the modification, I used a good quality 25 watt soldering iron 
with a very small tip, some desoldering braid, and a hemostat (medical 
locking forceps) with a small tip.  You will also need a magnifying 
glass to check your work.
</p><p>
Removing R151
</p><p>
This is the most difficult part of the modification.  Find R151 on the 
underside of the board.  Each part, including R151, has been glued to 
the motherboard.  R151 also has two circuit board traces running under 
the resistor, so prying underneath the resistor to loosen the glue is 
not a good idea.

I first removed excess solder from the ends of the resistor with the 
desoldering braid.  Be careful not to overheat the motherboard as you 
can damage the inner layers of the board.  I then clamped the hemostat 
over the resistor, and, while applying heat to the ends, gently twisted 
the resistor to remove it.  (Those of you with proper tools, please stop
 laughing.  I did what I could with what I had.)
</p><p>
After I made the modification, James McPhail wrote:
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
I remove SMT resistors with two soldering irons, one in each hand.  Heat
 up both ends and flip it aside when it is loose. I don't find the glue 
is much of a problem.
</blockquote>
<p>
Adding R152
</p><p>
Put the 1.2K resistor in place.  Hold it down with a tiny flat blade 
screwdriver while you solder the ends, otherwise the resistor will stick
 to the soldering iron.
</p><p>
Congratulations! You now have a Quadra 650 (running at 25 MHz).  Make 
the clock chipping modifications that Marc Schrier has described, and 
you, too, can have a 40 MHz machine.

In his September 93 posting, James McPhail wrote:
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
I measured the temperature of the CPU heatsink and found the following (closed box, no NuBus cards).<br>
Ambient 23   degrees C<br>
25 MHz  42.0 degrees C<br>
40 MHz  47.5 degrees C<br>
So if you keep the box closed, it is clear that no additional CPU cooling is necessary.

<p>
He also mentioned to me recently that his Centris 650 is still running 
fine at 40 MHz.  Good luck to all who make this modification!

There are a few more bits of information that have come out since Marlin posted this file:
<ul>
<li>This modification only seems to work well if you have the full 68040
 processor.  If you have a 68LC040 you might want to think about getting
 one with the mathcoprocessor before accelerating to 40MHz.
</li><li>SIMMs should be added in pairs of two.  If you already have one
 you should purchase another SIMM of the same size before accelerating 
to 40MHz.
</li><li><a href="http://www.io.com/~oe/Resistance.html">Join the Resistance!</a> by sending a Self Addressed Stamped Envelope to <a href="http://www.io.com/~oe">Output Enablers</a>, and they will send you a 1.2k Ohm (122) surface mount resistor for free.
